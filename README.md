A solution  made by myself for the challenge, created by FE Mentor. The application is responsive and matches and the layout design approximately 90%, though some grids are slightly rearranged.  I made some research on 
Internet to find the interest formulas, because I am not good at Finance Banking. I used also a bit of AI to help me with the focus states, some accesibility improvements(so the form can be completed with the keyboard).
I practiced various CSS selectors like ::after and ::before, I discovered new ones like :has().
